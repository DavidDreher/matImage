MatImage is a Matlab library for analysis and processing of digital images.
It contains functions for processing, analysis, and exploration of 2D, 3D, 
grayscale or color images. It is built as a complement to the Image Processing
Toolbox (IPT), and provides additional features as well as integration of IPT
functions into more elaborate functions.
